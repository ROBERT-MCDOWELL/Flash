# Foo Flash Framework (FFF)
#### Open Source SWF and Flash API Web Framework for Node.js.

This Git is intended to join knowledge, collaboration,
cooperation and skills to think of a new way to use 
the amazing Flash API pioneer web technology that created since
decades games, rich internet applications with enthusiasm, creativity and performance

As Adobe decided to stop to maintain Flash we decided to create
this git to share links, information but also why not
open the door to all of developers who love to code with Actionscript
and find the best compromise between the legacy and new environments.

Everyone is welcome to be involved in FFF and share competences,
experiences, links, knowledge and creativity to succeed the challenge!
