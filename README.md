# Foo Flash Framework (FFF)
#### Open Source Web Framework based on Rust, SWF and Flash API compatible.

This Git is intended to join knowledge, collaboration,
cooperation and skills to think of a new way to use 
the amazing Flash API technology that created during
the last 20 years wonderful projects and enthusiasm and creativity.

As Adobe decided to stop to maintain Flash we decided to create
this git to share links, information but also why not
open the door to all of developers who love to code with Actionscript
and find the best compromise between the legacy and and new environments.

Everyone is welcome to be involved in FFF and share competences,
experiences, knowledge and creativity to succeed the challenge!
