# Future-Flash
Open Source Flash Actionscript Next Generation with webassembly integration

This Git is intended to join knowledge, collaboration, cooperation and skills
to think a new way to use the amazing Flash Plugin technology that created during
the last 20 years wonderful projects and enthusiasm among developers and users.

As Adobe decided to stop to maintain Flash Plugin I decided to create this git
to share links, information but also why not open the door to all of developers
who love to code in with Actionscript framework to find the best compromise
to integrate the most transparent possible existing swf and new ones.
