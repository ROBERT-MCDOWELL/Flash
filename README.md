# Foo Flash Framework (FFF)
#### Open Source Web Framework based on Rust, SWF and Flash API compatible.

This Git is intended to join knowledge, collaboration, cooperation and skills
to think a new way to use the amazing Flash API technology that created during
the last 20 years wonderful projects and enthusiasm and creativity.

As Adobe decided to stop to maintain the Flash Plugin we decided to create this git
to share links, information but also why not open the door to all of developers
who love to code in with Actionscript to find the best compromise
to integrate the most transparent possible existing swf and new environment like Rust.

Everyone is welcome to be involved in FFF and share competences,
knowledge and creativity to success the challenge!
